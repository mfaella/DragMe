# DragMe

DragMe is an Android app that simulates the movement of a set of rigid bodies in 2D.
Bodies can be dragged around using the touchscreen.
They are subject to gravity, whose direction is alined to the earth thanks to accelerometer data.

It is intended as an educational project, showing how to use the JLiquidFun library for
physics simulations.

Part of the "Game Design and Development" curriculum at the University of Naples "Federico II", Italy.
